# OrthoQA-300

**OrthoQA-300** is a synthetic question-answering dataset focused on orthopedic surgery. Each entry simulates a realistic patient-provider interaction, with a patient-style question and a clinician-style response generated by large language models (LLMs). 

The dataset is categorized by procedure (e.g., ACL Reconstruction, Total Hip Replacement) and communication theme (e.g., “What is it?”, “Recovery”, “Risks”), providing structure that supports downstream analysis and tooling.


## Why This Dataset?

Orthopedic surgery is one of the most common clinical specialties, yet it lacks accessible, structured datasets for language model evaluation or prototyping. Real-world patient-provider transcripts are difficult to obtain due to privacy, cost, and scalability.

**OrthoQA-300** provides a safe, repeatable sandbox for:

- Comparing LLM outputs on clinical questions
- Testing evaluation tools (e.g., hallucination or accuracy scoring)
- Prototyping medical QA agents or chat systems
- Exploring instruction-tuning or prompt strategies for clinical NLP

While the dataset contains no gold-standard or human-validated answers, it offers controlled structure for use in early-stage research and tool development.

## Dataset Overview

| Field       | Description                                               |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `question`  | A patient-style question about a surgical procedure       |
| `answer`    | LLM-generated response in a provider-style tone           |
| `procedure` | Surgical procedure (e.g., "ACL Reconstruction")           |
| `theme`     | Communication theme (e.g., "Recovery", "Risks")           |

**Note:** All content is synthetic. No real patient data or PHI was used.

## Example

```json
{
  "question": "Can you explain what ACL reconstruction surgery actually involves?",
  "answer": "ACL reconstruction is a procedure where the torn ligament is replaced with a graft...",
  "procedure": "ACL Reconstruction",
  "theme": "What is it?"
}
