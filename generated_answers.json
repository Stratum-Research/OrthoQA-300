    "question": "Can you explain in simple terms what ACL reconstruction surgery actually involves?",
    "procedure": "ACL Reconstruction",
    "theme": "What is it?",
    "answer": "As an orthopedic surgeon, here's what ACL reconstruction involves in simple terms:\n\n1.  **We replace your torn ACL ligament:** Since a torn ACL rarely heals on its own, we remove the damaged ligament and replace it with a strong graft (tissue taken from another part of your knee, like your hamstring tendon or patellar tendon, or sometimes from a donor).\n2.  **It's done using keyhole surgery (arthroscopy):** We make small incisions around your knee and use a tiny camera and specialized instruments to precisely position the graft through tunnels drilled in your thigh and shin bones, securing it with screws or other devices to act as your new ligament.\n3.  **The goal is to restore knee stability:** This procedure aims to stop the knee from giving way, allowing you to safely return to sports and activities requiring pivoting or cutting movements.\n\nThe focus is on reconstructing the ligament's function using a graft, not repairing the original torn tissue."

    "question": "Can you explain what a total hip replacement surgery actually involves, step by step?",
    "procedure": "Total Hip Replacement",
    "theme": "What is it?",
    "answer": "Here is a concise, step-by-step explanation of a total hip replacement:\n\n1.  **Anesthesia & Exposure:** You receive anesthesia (general or spinal), and the surgeon makes an incision over the hip joint (anterior, posterior, or lateral approach) to access the damaged femoral head and acetabulum (hip socket).\n2.  **Bone Preparation & Implantation:** The damaged femoral head is removed, and the femoral canal is shaped to accept a metal stem implant. The acetabulum is reamed and fitted with a durable socket liner (often plastic, ceramic, or metal). A ball component (metal or ceramic) is then attached to the stem.\n3.  **Testing & Closure:** The surgeon checks the joint's stability, range of motion, and leg length. Drains may be placed, and the deep tissues and skin are meticulously closed with sutures or staples.\n\n**The goal is to replace the damaged joint surfaces with artificial components, restoring pain-free movement.**"
